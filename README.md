## Data Analysis On Suicide Bombing Attacks in Pakistan 

Analysis about crime data is really interesting thing to me. I have done data analysis about pakistan terrorism dataset.

I believe visualizing about crime history helps people have better understandings about crime and terrorisms.
Also I think having good understanding about terrorisms has never been more important in human history.

So, I hope this will helps you understand a little bit more about crime and terrorism in Pakistan.
